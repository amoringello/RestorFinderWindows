# RestorFinderWindows
Save and Restore Mac OS X Finder Windows. Re-Opens previously saved windows location and tabs.

Exported the binary .SCP as .TXT so you can read them easily.
Included the .APP files so you don't need to Export them from the ScriptEditor.

Run the "Save Finder Windows.app" to save your window positions and tabs.
If Finder crashes, or you need to reboot, and windows do not restore properly, run the "Restore Finder Windows" to open the previously saved windows.  Restore DOES NOT close any currently open windows.
